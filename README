This repository contains the OpenWrt tree used to build images for eTactica
devices, for releases based on the OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 branch.

In general, the patches are in three groups
* Support for our devices
* some backports from later releases
* some minor changes to defaults to suit our device type

To generate the list of changes, use the following git commands:

    $ git checkout rme [1]
    $ git remote add upstream [2] <upstream url>
    $ git cherry -v upstream/master | upstream/chaos_calmer


[1] Releases up to and including "rme-gate-v1.26.0" are based on the "rme" branch
Subsequent releases are based on the "rme2" branch.
[2] Releases up to and included "rme-gate-v1.26.0" are based on 
   https://git.openwrt.org/15.05/openwrt.git;master
Subsequent releases are based on https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git;chaos_calmer

After the LEDE/OpenWrt split, the original upstream branch was force-pushed.
This is the unfortunate reason behind the split branches/upstreams.


---- Original README below ----

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
